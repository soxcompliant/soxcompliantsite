        <h1>Sox Compliant</h2>
        <h3>Your Path to SOX 404A Compliance</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Sox Compliant, the premier consultancy dedicated to helping your company achieve SOX 404A compliance. Whether your company has recently gone public, is transitioning from SOX 404B to 404A, or wants to ensure audit readiness, our services are tailored to meet your needs.</p>

        <h2>SOX 404B vs. 404A</h2>
        <p>The transition from SOX 404B to SOX 404A involves moving from self-certification to mandatory external audits. Our team collaborates with Big Four auditing firms to ensure smooth external audits and thorough preparations.</p>
        
        <p>Extracting and analyzing Segregation of Duties (SOD) matrices is a critical aspect of SOX compliance. The variations among different platforms in data extraction can be overwhelming. At Sox Compliant, we specialize in crafting ITGC (IT General Controls), ITAC (IT Application Controls), and SOD workbooks tailored to your organization's specific needs. We also develop and manage your Risk Control Matrix (RCM), identifying risks and their associated controls. From sourcing SOD data to implementing auditor-preferred controls such as 'floor to sheet, sheet to floor' checks, we equip your operations team with the knowledge and tools necessary for sustained compliance.</p>
        
        <h3>Your Trusted Partner in SOX Compliance</h3>
        <p>SOX compliance targets financial controls, but IT controls often pose the greatest challenge. Trust Sox Compliant to guide your company with authoritative guidance and customized solutions, ensuring audit readiness.</p>
